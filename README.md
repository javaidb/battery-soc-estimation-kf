# Battery Stage of Charge (SOC) Estimation 

This repository is intended as a sandbox to develop, test and implement estimation techniques for state of charge of a sample lithium-ion battery..

Models built on TensorFlow and modeled on datasets [LG 18650HG2](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/cp3473x7xv/3) and  [Panasonic 18650PF](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/wykht8y7tg/1).
